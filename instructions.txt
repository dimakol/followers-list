Followers List

Your assignment is to create a React + Redux + Typescript + Single Page Application, that has the following flow:

    1. Ask the user to enter a name of a Github account.

    2. Display the list of 30 of that account’s followers. (https://api.github.com/users/${name)/followers)

        a. If the list is longer than 30, implement a way to view the rest of the list.

    3. Allow the user to sort the current list by their Login Name and ID.

The assignment will be tested by the following criteria:

    1. General code quality.

    2. Project structure and architecture.

    3. User experience.

Use any design framework of your choice (tailwindcss, material-ui, chakra-ui)

The project should be handed in as a git repo, and we should be able to install and run it locally on our machines.

Extra points if you deploy it to some static site host (Github pages, Netlify, Vercel, Heroku...)

Please make sure to provide installation instructions and other notes of import in the ‘README’ file.

The time frame for this assignment is until Sunday, June 5th.
We are here for any question or issue that might arise.

Good luck!
